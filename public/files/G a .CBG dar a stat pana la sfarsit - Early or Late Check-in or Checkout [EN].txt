Dear __________,


My name is Samir and I am part of the Airbnb Community. We hope you are doing well. We tried to call you, but we were unable to reach you.

We are contacting you regarding the reservation HME5Z4YRXW with Laura (Check-in Apr 16, 2024 - Check-out Apr 25, 2024).

Your host informed us that you canceled the reservation by mistake and that you stayed for the entire reservation period. When you canceled, the system automatically processed a refund according to the Cancellation Policy.

Can you confirm these details?




la H
Secondo le procedure, dovremmo contattare l'ospite. Al momento, l'ospite non ha risposto, proveremo a contattarlo nuovamente.

Hi Laura,

I have been investigating your case and I have been able to see that you have an open request for payment in the resolution center.
In this case, having a procedure already in place to adjust payments related to Billy's first booking, you have to wait for Billy to respond, (he has a 72-hour period from the start of the request to do so).
If Billy is unwilling to pay the amount asked or unresponsive within the next 46 hours, you may choose to ask Airbnb for assistance at that time to initiate mediation.

I'm sending you an article from the help center with information about the Resolution Center so you can check it out whenever you need it:

Please don't hesitate to contact us again when you need us, we'll be happy to help!
Best regards,

Hi Laura,

I hope all is well!

This is Sumit, one of the Support Ambassadors here at Airbnb and I hope this message finds you well.

I just wanted to connect with you regarding the cancellation for your reservation HME5Z4YRXW in which the Guest accidentally cancelled the reservation as they wanted to change the dates. But as per your policy he cannot get refund for the remaining nights. If you would like to respect the Guest's decision as they really do not have any choice you may help him to get refund for remaining nights so that rebook again for the nights they wanted to change the reservation to.

Please let me know as soon as possible as the Guest is really stressed out for this.

Hope to see your listing flourished with lots of reservations. Should you have any questions in the future, do not hesitate to reach out to us, we are available 24*7 just a message or call away! www.airbnb.com/help Wishing you great success in 2024

A booking cannot be reinstated once cancelled, However you can help them get back refund for remaining nights and then ask them to book again for new dates.
