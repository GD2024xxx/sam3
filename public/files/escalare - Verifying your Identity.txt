Hello Johannes,

It's Boryana again. I would like to thank you for the nice conversation earlier.

I'm just writing to confirm what we talked about on the phone.

I'm very sorry that you had difficulties with the verification.

I've gladly forwarded the case to the responsible colleagues so that the photos of your ID can be checked manually. As soon as we receive a response, we will inform you accordingly.

You can find more information on the subject of verification in our Help Center article:

https://www.airbnb.de/help/article/3033

Thank you in advance for your patience.

Best regards,
Boryana

Hello SIlvia, we have created this chat just to give you
extra information on how to proceed in case of any
problem during the reservation.

***PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE***

Here are our contact numbers in case you need
to speak to us urgently:
*Spain (Monday to Sunday 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM GMT): +34
911234567
*24/7 Contact Line (English only): +1-415-800-5959

If you have a problem during your stay:
Document the problem and send a message to the host
Here are the steps you should follow:

Document the problem: If you can, take photos or record videos
to illustrate what happened, for example, if
something is missing or doesn't work.
Send a message to the host: Don't hesitate to write to them if
you have any setbacks during your stay. This is the most
practical thing to do, as they will most likely be able to help you
resolve the unforeseen event. You can send a message
directly to your host to let them know what happened.
Request a refund: If you want to ask for
compensation for the issue you've encountered,
they'll probably be more likely to agree to it if
you agree on an amount first. Submit your request through the
Resolution Center and provide details of the
issue, along with photos or videos.
Ask Airbnb for help resolving the issue
While we prefer hosts and guests come
to an agreement directly, we realize that sometimes
that's not possible. If your host can't resolve the
issue, declines your refund request, or isn't
responding, just say so! Go to the booking page
and select Get help. Someone on our team can then
step in to find a solution.

If we believe the issue is covered by AirCover
for Guests, we'll help you find a
similar listing at a similar price, depending on
availability. If there isn't one available or you don't want to book
another, we'll send you a full or partial refund.

If an emergency situation occurs or your safety is at
stake
If you feel that your safety is at risk or you are
in a situation that requires urgent attention, contact
your local police or emergency services
immediately. If you do not know their phone number,
If you're on a phone, you can use Airbnb to call instantly.

For any other safety concerns, please remember that
you can reach us through our
24-hour safety line. You can reach us by phone, email,
or chat and receive priority assistance from
a team specially trained to handle
safety-related issues.

What to do if your host doesn't respond:

If a host doesn't respond to a booking request
Unless you've chosen a listing with Instant Book,
hosts have 24 hours to accept or decline
a booking request. Learn more about
host response times.

If a host doesn't respond and you have a confirmed reservation
When you have a confirmed reservation, you'll be able to see
your host's phone number in the message thread
for your trip. You can also send them a message or open the
Airbnb app to call them.
Learn more about how to contact
hosts in this article.

If you'd like to check-in instructions,
please note that they'll be available on the
reservation itinerary page 48 hours before your
stay begins.

If you haven't been able to locate the host by any
means, please contact us.

We will consider this issue resolved for now, then
a sign will appear that says "Do you still need help?" and
click on "No, everything is already resolved."

But if you have another question you can contact
the Airbnb Customer Service team. If
you need us, we are at your disposal on this page:
www.airbnb.com/help

Best regards,
Airbnb Team

Hello Silvia,

Yes, this is referring to reservation HM4H8ZD3R2. Please note that it
was cancelled by the system as your identity was
verified after the reservation was made.

Now that it has been verified, this should not be a
problem for you.

Do you need assistance with anything else?
If not, I will allow myself to close our conversation. It was
a pleasure talking to you. I hope I have helped you. Please do not hesitate
to contact us again if you have any further
questions.

You can contact us at any time at the
following address: https://www.airbnb.es/help? or by calling
+34 911234567.

Best regards,
The Airbnb Support Team.

Hi Jorge,

Trust is central to the way we work. It's why we ask guests and Hosts alike to provide a photo ID, so that our community can travel and host in confidence.

Sometimes, you may be asked to do this before making a booking. You can do this on our platform by following these steps:

airbnb.com/account-verification

Or by following these steps in our app:

Log in > Profile > Personal info > Government ID > Add

For more information, check out this article in our Help Center:

Regards,
Airbnb Support
