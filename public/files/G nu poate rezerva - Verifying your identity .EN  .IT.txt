Hi Sannan,

Good day! I hope this message finds you well. This is Alexis, one of the Support Ambassadors in Airbnb, I tried to contact you however, I was routed to your voicemail.

I understand that you have difficulties making reservation here in Airbnb and I'm sorry for the inconvenience that you encountered. As per checking here on my system, that you're still not uploading your Government ID and selfie in your Airbnb account.

I suggest to you to first upload your Government ID and take a selfie to your Airbnb account. Please make sure that the photo you will upload must be cleared and not blurred. I will give you the steps how to upload your Government ID and selfie below.

These are the steps how to upload your Government ID in your Airbnb account:

1. Go to your account
2. Then click the Personal Info
3. Once you already click the Personal info you will see the Government ID at below of Phone number
4. Click the Add
5. Next you can now upload your Government ID and the next step is the selfie
6. After uploading it you can click Save

Once your Government ID and selfie already verified that's the time you try to book a reservation here in Airbnb. I will also provide to you some Help Center link.

Hi Victoria,

My name is Divine Grace, a member of the Airbnb Community Support team. I understand you're seeking assistance and I will be helping you with this case. Please allow me a moment to review your case and provide you with the necessary information.



Hi Victoria,

I'm Divine Grace M. from the Airbnb Community Support team and I'll help you. Unfortunately, we do not have Spanish Language Ambassadors. However, I will answer in English and then translate it into your language with the help of a translation tool. I hope you are good.



For this one, since you mentioned that you were not able to access the reservation on the other account, I am forwarding your case to the dedicated team that will be able to assist you. While response times may vary, they will respond in a timely manner.

You may now close the Airbnb app, but please make sure notifications are enabled so that you're alerted when they‚Äôll reply.

If you're unsure on how to enable notifications, we have detailed instructions at the following Help Center article:

Hi Victoria,

Thank you for contacting us. I'm Glydel, one of Airbnb's Support Ambassadors. I'd love to call you, but it's past your normal office hours. Therefore, confirm your availability and we will contact you as soon as possible.

I understand that you have a reservation scheduled, but it does not appear in this account. Checking here, this reservation (HMTBDP3X2N) was made through a different account, not this account. Unfortunately, it is not possible to transfer the reservation to this account.

Please confirm if you can still access the account used to make the reservation. It is very important that we also discuss this over the phone for verification purposes, so please let us know your preferred time to communicate by phone.

Hi Victoria,

I have realized that we no longer received a reply from you on your case. Therefore, I would like to know if everything is fine?

I would love to call you, but the timezone difference is not allowing us to speak over the phone, so I'm just sending this follow-up message instead. Please confirm your availability, and we will contact you as soon as possible.

As discussed, your reservation (HMTBDP3X2N) was booked using a different account, not this account. Unfortunately, there is no option to transfer the reservation to this account. You would need to access the account that you used to book the reservation. You can log in using the email address or the phone number associated on that account to log in.

For more information, you can check this link:

Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that I'll go ahead and close out our conversation for the time being. If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach back. We would be more than happy to assist you!

Thanks for being a valuable member of the Airbnb community. You may also reach out to our team through the contact page in our Help Center: www.airbnb.com/help/contact_us

Have a wonderful day and stay safe!

Hi Darren,

This is Neil one of the ambassador from the Airbnb. I was planning to call you, but I found out this is not the right time to do it.

Furthermore, I went through your previous message and your concern was referring to your verifying identity, I understand that this important to you and this should be process immediately, As per my investigation I found out that you still haven't done to verify your Identity and if you don't take any action verifying your account you won‚Äôt be able to book a reservation, I just wanted to let you know that Airbnb wanted to make sure that all profiles are real that's the reason why all users need to undergo with this method even a Host needs to verify their account, but I just wanted to you give you a heads-up that this is a one time process only, and I guarantee you a smooth transaction whenever you try to book any listing or reservation.

Please click this link to get more information about how to verify identity:

Please do not hesitate to reach back to us if in any case you need further assistance from us.

Regards,
Neil.
